I've been aware over the past while that I wanted to write some more. 

I've also wanted to build up more of my Laravel skills and use this domain more actively.

Before, I'd played around with Jeykll but it didn't quite stick. Jigsaw seems to make a bit more sense to me.

Why? Well, firstly it is written in PHP (more specifically Laravel) which means I can more clearly see what is going on.

I like how easy it is to wire in Vue components and I also appreciate that it isn't very opinionated. 

I'm adapting this bit by bit and so it will probably change a bit around here while I do that. I'm hoping that this will be a helpful space for me to think about technical things but also other bits that touch on my work and life.
